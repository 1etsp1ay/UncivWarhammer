In those distant times, the fathers of Men were nothing but fur-clad savages, barely distinguishable from Orcs in the eyes of the haughty Elves. It was the Dwarfs who recognised the potential of Humanity, first as trading partners, but eventually as allies against the Orcs that infested the land."},

It was Sigmar who rescued Kurgan from the Orcs, and in honour of this valiant act the Dwarf king gave him the great warhammer Skull Splitter. For ever after the Emperor was known as Sigmar Heldenhammer and was accounted a true friend of the Dwarfs, the greatest honour a Dwarf can bestow. Sigmar united all the warring Human tribes under his rule and established the realm that is known today as the Empire."},
			{"text": "Sigmar's day was over two thousand years ago and since that time the Empire has survived many long and arduous wars. It has suffered Orc and Goblin invasions, the devastations of the Vampire Counts, and the dreaded incursions of Chaos armies. It has also endured periods of rebellion and anarchy within its own borders."},

			{"text": "Despite times of changing fortune, even during its long periods of disunity and division, the Empire has always maintained its sense of identity as one land and one people, under the spiritual, if not actual, leadership of Sigmar, who is now accorded the status of patron god of his ancient realm."},

It stretches from the Grey Mountains and the borders of Bretonnia in the south to the Forest of Shadows and the land of Kislev in the north. Eastwards it is bounded by the Sea of Claws and the wilderness known as the Wasteland. Westwards the borderlands lie upon the foothills of the World's Edge Mountains."},
			{"text": "Within the Empire's boundaries lie dark forests, mighty rivers and tall, forbidding mountains. For the most part these are wild and untamed, the refuge of evil creatures and brigands of all kinds. The real strength of the Empire lies in its sprawling cities and the lesser towns and farms that lie under their protection."},
			{"text": "The Empire is a great commercial as well as military power, whose cities prosper in a new age of enlightenment and growth. In the busy markets, rich merchants jostle with scholars, and dour warriors rub shoulders with skilled artisans. In the deep harbours of Altdorf, ocean-going ships unload cargoes from all over the world. Altdorf is also the home of the Colleges of Magic, the foremost schools of sorcery in the Old World, and of the Imperial Zoo, which maintains a stable of many fantastic monstrous creatures."},

The greatest of these nations is the Empire, a land which stands upon the dawn of a new age of exploration and discovery. However, the growth and even survival of the Empire is by no means certain, for there are many perils that threaten its future, not least of which is the growing shadow of Chaos in the north. Such perils must be faced and overcome if Mankind is to flourish. But the greatest danger lies within, for even inside the Empire there are those who seek the aid of the Dark Gods of Chaos, who would trade the freedom of Man for a brief taste of power. Indeed, the witch hunters of the Emperor are kept almost as busy as the soldiers of its armies."},

The Elves once built ports and tall towers, palaces and pinnacles, to serve their colonies in Old World. For a while they prospered, their cities grew, and the inhabitants became wealthy as a result of trade with the Dwarfs and primitive Human tribes. When the Elves and Dwarfs went to war, the land was devastated by the opposing armies. Eventually, after many long years of fighting, the Elves sailed back into the west and abandoned the Old World altogether. The Dwarfs too gave up on the land beyond the mountains, and so the whole area was deserted and forgotten."},
			{"text": "With the disappearance of the Elves and Dwarfs, the land was quickly overrun by Orcs, Goblins and the rough Human tribes who were almost as brutal in those far off days. For many hundreds of years the area remained divided between rival warlords, both green-skinned and Human, until the time of Gilles of the tribe of Bretonni. In his day the realm was united, and as one nation the Bretonnians succeeded in defeating and driving out the Orcs and Goblins. It is from this time that the Bretonnians date the creation of their kingdom, some 977 years after the time of Sigmar and the founding of the Empire. "},
			{"text": "To this day the Knights of Bretonnia follow the chivalric traditions established in the time of Gilles le Breton. Gilles' vision of the Lady of the Lake on the eve of battle foretold of his holy purpose and ultimate destiny as king of Bretonnia. Since then the warriors of Bretonnia have pledged themselves to the service of the Lady of the Lake, and sought to uphold the knightly virtues in her name. By feat of arms a Knight may rise in esteem and become, by degrees, one of those marked by the goddess for her special honour. That reward is to drink, as Gilles le Breton once drank, from the Lady's Grail, as only those who are pure in heart and deed can do."},
			{"text": "Bretonnia has grown into a powerful nation under the guidance of its king, the Lady of the Lake, and the code of honour under which its nobility conducts itself in peace and war. There are no other men whose martial prowess can equal the Knights of Bretonnia, dedicated as they are, body and soul, to the pursuit of excellence. Indeed, it is often said that the Knights of Bretonnia could conquer the world were it not for their vows which bind them to protect their own domain and shield the poor and innocent from unwarranted hostility."},
			{"text": "Though a Knight's code of honour binds him to the protection of his land and people, there are still times when he finds himself bound for war in foreign lands. When the Sultan Jaffar of Araby invaded the lands of Estalia, the king of Bretonnia, at that time Louis the Righteous, raised a mighty army pledged to free Estalia from his evil grasp. During the Crusades which followed not only was Estalia freed but the Bretonnian king took the war to Araby itself and destroyed the empire of Jaffar. Filled with crusading zeal the Knights tore down the decadent palaces of the Sultan, burned many evil tomes from his library, and flung down the dark idols from his unholy temples."},
			{"text": "Today the king of Bretonnia and his Knights form a bulwark against the growing evils of Chaos and the power of the Orcs, Goblins, Skaven and other monstrous creatures that threaten Mankind's survival. The Bretonnians are protected by their honour and by their strength of arms and, whilst they endure, the lands of Men remain safe from peril. If the Knights of Bretonnia were ever to fail in their sacred duties, then the Human race would surely be doomed."},

Yet no matter how far away they may be, all Ogres refer to the scattered tribal kingdoms that dominate the slopes and river valleys of the Mountains of Mourn their rightful, hard-earned homeland. It is here, amongst the frozen peaks and blistering blizzards that mighty Tyrants rule over their own brutal kingdoms, warring amongst each other, looting, extorting and ransacking all before them as a tribute to their own gluttonous appetite and their ever-hungry god, the Great Maw."},

Yet such is the Ogres ferocious, stubborn and ever ravenous nature that they see these creatures not as a foe to cower and hide from, but as a challenge that needs to be brought down, crushed beneath their boot and eaten to fill their hungry bellies."},

It was the Ogres who brought down the mighty Sky-Titans of the upper Peaks, bringing their civilisation low and condemning their children into exile or enslavement.[1f] It is they who once claimed a mighty realm within the Great Steppes of the Far East, battling the ancient Grand Empire of Cathay for supremacy before the day came that their malevolent and ever-hungry God, the Great Maw punished the Ogres for their sins and brought about the Great Migration of their race.[1e] That was many thousands of years ago, and as the Ogres grow in numbers once more, the cycle of history is set to repeat itself. Should nothing stop them now, it is said that the Ogres will stop at nothing to devour every living thing within this ravaged world. "},

			{"text": "The Moot or the Mootland is an autonomous region governed by Halflings located between Averland and Stirland. Administrative autonomy was granted to the little folk by Ludwig the Fat in 1000 IC, during the Age of Three Emperors, after he decided it was about time to give them their own land to govern as they see fit. Ludwig's advisers at the time told him that he cannot possibly grant the Halflings this just because they had contributed to the Imperial cuisine. Nevertheless, Ludwig the Fat issued the edict that the Moot should be its own province and even be permitted an electoral vote (much to the consternation of his more conservative advisers.)"},
			{"text": "The Moot is formed by a collection of villages, each one headed by an Elder. The Elders meet fairly frequently, called a District Moot, in a selected village which has been voted for by the Elders; such things as prestige and monthly yield is important in the voting process. Topics debated in a District Moot covers the harvest, which is one of the most important areas of discussion, how many fields should be left fallow, if any are flooded, as well as other crop rotation and fertility issues; where herds should be allowed to graze, if they are producing enough milk or not; whether the cheese is up to standard; the amount of pipe weed grown; and if there are any concerns over possible bandit activity. Before the District Moot the chair-halfling is elected by the Elders and this individual actually becomes an Imperial Elector with the power to vote for a new Emperor!"},
			{"text": " District Moot is a sight to behold for it is a gigantic banquet where the village Elders smoke enormous amounts of pipe weed and drink ale by the gallon. For some Elders the attendance of a District Moot depends on the size of the banquet and what is being served. Some conservative Elders (those with strong Halfling traditions) will baulk if half a dozen extra helpings of meat pie are not forthcoming and won't attend. Often the local Electors, usually Averland and Stirland, will send emissaries to a District Moot to watch and take note of the proceedings (when politics is finally discussed after the first seven courses) because little do the Halflings know that they could have an influential say on Imperial politics. One of the Emperor's own Plenipotentiaries is always present at any District Moot, as whoever becomes an Imperial Elector from the assembled Halflings could prove to be an important associate and ally. The Emperor's Plenipotentiary will also keep an eye on any other officials sent by the Electors."},
			{"text": "Although the Moot relies heavily on Imperial protection it does at least have its own militia, which the Count of Stirland in particular insists upon, to help with combating bandits in the region. Mostly they are a defensive force and not very well equipped to attack. The Halflings make great use of their culinary skills for homeland defence. Just as most Halflings are excellent cooks and can prepare delicious meals some can also prepare cocktails designed to actually harm a foe and even these ingredients are closely guarded secrets just like an old woman won't divulge the secrets of her recipe book. The cocktails are boiled by the cauldron load and contain ferociously hot spices, as well as peppermint herbs, firebalm, and even dabs of gunpowder. The mixture turns out to be quite a wicked brew and highly flammable, not to mention effective when launched from a catapult. Indeed, mixtures of this kind are very effective against goblinoids; apparently the hot spices and herbs play merry havoc with their fungus-like metabolism. This could be one of the reasons why bands of goblinoids aren't as much of a problem as perhaps they should be on the Moot's borders; the stench given off by the boiling brew is enough to put most creatures off from getting too close. This lethal, stinking concoction is reasonably harmless to a Halfling should one consume a portion (he or she may suffer from an hour or two of stomach pains and intermittent blasts of wind) but to a human it is far more unpleasant; this includes almost immediate unconsciousness and at least two weeks, or more, of diarrhoea."},
			{"text": "In return for their Imperial vote, the Moot sends some of their finest cooks to the Imperial court and sends small groups of their foresters to serve for a time in the Imperial army. Halflings are not born warriors but they make competent bowmen and can make hardly a sound when wandering through undergrowth. This makes them ideal scouts although their use in any Imperial army is largely symbolic and few Empire generals want them in their army. Halflings in defence of their homes are determined and doughty fighters, however."}
